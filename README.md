# ANN_keras_tuner

The code will explain how to perform automatic hyperparameter tuning with Keras Tuner and Tensorflow 2.3.1 to boost accuracy.
The Keras team released Keras Tuner, a library to easily perform hyperparameter tuning with Tensorflow 2.0.
The code will show how to use it with an application in ANN.

The dataset i.e customers records privided in  churn_modelling.csv file and by using ANN we need to predict whether a customer will churn or not.
